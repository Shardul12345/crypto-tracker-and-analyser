  The "Cryptocurrency Tracker and Analyzer" project aims to provide users with a comprehensive tool to track and analyze various cryptocurrencies in real time.
  The primary features of the project include:

1. Cryptocurrency Table:
The project displays a table of cryptocurrencies, which includes essential information such as name, current price, 24-hour change (price in percentage), and market capitalization. The table can be sorted based on these parameters, allowing users to identify top-performing cryptocurrencies quickly.

2. Cryptocurrency Charts:
When a user clicks on a particular cryptocurrency from the table, the project displays a price chart for that specific cryptocurrency. The chart shows the price movements over different time frames, including the last 24 hours, 30 days, 3 months, and one year. This feature enables users to gain valuable insights into the historical performance of the cryptocurrency and make more informed decisions.

3. Watchlist:
Users have the option to create a personalized watchlist of cryptocurrencies they wish to monitor closely. They can add specific cryptocurrencies to their watchlist, and the project will provide real-time updates on their price movements. This feature allows users to keep a close eye on their selected cryptocurrencies without having to search for them repeatedly.

4. Priority Watchlist:
The project introduces a unique feature called the "Priority Watchlist," which enables users to add additional parameters to the cryptocurrencies they are tracking. Along with the cryptocurrency's name, price, and priority, users can also set an entry and expiry date, as well as add a note about the cryptocurrency. This feature caters to users who want to manage their cryptocurrency investments actively and set specific targets and timeframes for their trades.

5. Tracking and Analysis:
The primary goal of the project is to provide users with the tools they need to track and analyze various cryptocurrencies efficiently. By displaying real-time data, historical price charts, and personalized watchlists, users can make informed decisions about their cryptocurrency investments.

  In conclusion, the "Cryptocurrency Tracker and Analyzer" project offers a comprehensive solution for users to track and analyze cryptocurrencies effectively.
The combination of a detailed cryptocurrency table, interactive price charts, customizable watchlists, and the unique priority watchlist feature makes this project a valuable tool for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. Whether users are interested in keeping an eye on the overall market or actively managing their investments, this project aims to provide the necessary features and functionality to assist them in their cryptocurrency endeavors.
